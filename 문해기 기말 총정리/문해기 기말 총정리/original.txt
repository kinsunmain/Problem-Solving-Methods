Tired of sitting in front of a computer screen and need a break from the busy city life 
If you are looking for a peaceful and relaxing place check out PyeongChang in Gangwon Province 
PyeongChang the popular winter sports resort located some 180 kilometers east of Seoul 
is now trying to establish itself as the countrys best year-round holiday destination
thanks to a new grand resort at Daegwallyeong
Nestled deep in the heart of clouds of mountains the Alpensia resort is the perfect 
location to relax and get away from it all
The distance from Seoul to PyeongChang may seem too much for a day trip But in fact 
it is two hours drive from Seoul On a Wednesday morning I hopped on a bus bound 
for Hwenggye from East Bus Terminal near Subway Line No 2 Gangbyeon Station 
Alpensia resort is only eight kilometers from the Hwenggye terminal
